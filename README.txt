ABOUT

Thanks for using cmislib, the CMIS client library for Python.

The goal of this library is to provide an interoperable API to CMIS
repositories such as Alfresco, Nuxeo, KnowledgeTree, MS SharePoint,
EMC Documentum, and any other content repository that is CMIS-compliant.

More info on CMIS can be found at:
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cmis

SOURCE

The source code for this project lives at http://chemistry.apache.org/

TESTS

There are unit tests available in the tests directory. They require access
to a CMIS provider. There are many freely-available CMIS repositories
available to run locally or that are hosted.

DOC

Documentation that tells you what this is all about can be found in the doc
directory. Please see the doc for dependencies, required CMIS version level,
required Python version, etc.

NOTES

To works with Python 2.7 and 3, checkout to branch trunk
