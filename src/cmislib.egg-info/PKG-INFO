Description: ABOUT
        
        Thanks for using cmislib, the CMIS client library for Python.
        
        The goal of this library is to provide an interoperable API to CMIS
        repositories such as Alfresco, Nuxeo, KnowledgeTree, MS SharePoint,
        EMC Documentum, and any other content repository that is CMIS-compliant.

        TESTS
        
        There are unit tests available in the tests directory. They require access
        to a CMIS provider. There are many freely-available CMIS repositories
        available to run locally or that are hosted.
